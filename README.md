# gitionary

The aim of the project is to make a "dictionary" of git terms. Why is the word "dictionary" in scare quotes? It'll be revealed in the moment...

Motivation
---

Have you ever encountered a situation where you read the git manual, then you read a word you don't understand, you look it up, afterwards you get a definition which contains a two another words you don't know the definition? As if you were doing depth-first search in the directed graph? The aim of this project is not to solve this problem.

The aim is to create a cheatsheet of git terms, which you can read from the beginning to the end, and quickly grok most common definitions. That's why a given definiton can refer only to the definitions presented earlier in the dictionary.

Goals and assumptions
---

First and foremost, KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid).

Definitions are not presented in the alphabetic order. And they are not supposed to be. If you want them in the alphabetic order, SORT THEM YOURSELF.

Don't add definitions that require knowledge of the words not presented earlier in the dictionary. And, what follows from the previous sentence, don't add cycles to the dictionary. 

Don't paste in several page-long definitions. This isn't Wikipedia. The shorter the definition, the better. But not at the price of understandability.
